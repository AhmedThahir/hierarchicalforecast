    "Large collections of time series organized into structures at different aggregation levels often require their forecasts to follow their aggregation constraints, which poses the challenge of creating novel algorithms capable of coherent forecasts.\n",

    "**HierarchicalForecast** offers a collection of reconciliation methods, including `BottomUp`, `TopDown`, `MiddleOut`, `MinTrace` and `ERM`. Along with data wrangling, evaluation and visualization tools for grouped and hierarchical series. And Probabilistic coherent predictions including `MinTrace-normality`, `Bootstrap`, and `PERM-BU` methods."

    "\n",
    "* Classic reconciliation methods:\n",
    "    - `BottomUp`: Simple addition to the upper levels.\n",
    "    - `TopDown`: Distributes the top levels forecasts trough the hierarchies.\n",
    "* Alternative reconciliation methods:\n",
    "    - `MiddleOut`: It anchors the base predictions in a middle level. The levels above the base predictions use the bottom-up approach, while the levels below use a top-down.\n",
    "    - `MinTrace`: Minimizes the total forecast variance of the space of coherent forecasts, with the Minimum Trace reconciliation.\n",
    "    - `ERM`: Optimizes the reconciliation matrix minimizing an L1 regularized objective.\n",
    "* Probabilistic coherent methods:\n",
    "    - `MinTrace-normality`: Uses MinTrace variance-covariance closed form matrix under a normality assumption.\n",
    "    - `Bootstrap`: Generates distribution of hierarchically reconciled predictions using Gamakumara's bootstrap approach.\n",
    "    - `PERM-BU`: Minimizes the total forecast variance of the space of coherent forecasts, with the Minimum Trace reconciliation.\n",

    "## ðŸ“– Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Short**: We want to contribute to the ML field by providing reliable baselines and benchmarks for hierarchical forecasting task in industry and academia. Here's the complete [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03517).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verbose**: `HierarchicalForecast` integrates publicly available processed datasets, evaluation metrics, and a curated set of statistical baselines. In this library we provide usage examples and references to extensive experiments where we showcase the baseline's use and evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. With this work, we hope to contribute to Machine Learning forecasting by bridging the gap to statistical and econometric modeling, as well as providing tools for the development of novel hierarchical forecasting algorithms rooted in a thorough comparison of these well-established models. We intend to continue maintaining and increasing the repository, promoting collaboration across the forecasting community."
